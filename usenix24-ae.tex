\section{Artifact Appendix}
% \textit{This artifact appendix is meant to be a self-contained document which
% describes a roadmap for the evaluation of your artifact. It should include a
% clear description of the hardware, software, and configuration requirements. In
% case your artifact aims to receive the functional or results reproduced badge,
% it should also include the major claims made by your paper and instructions on
% how to reproduce each claim through your artifact. Linking the claims of your
% paper to the artifact is a necessary step that ultimately allows artifact
% evaluators to reproduce your results.}

% \textit{Please fill all the mandatory sections, keeping their titles and
% organization but removing the current illustrative content, and remove the
% optional sections where those do not apply to your artifact.}

\subsection{Abstract}
% {\em [Mandatory]}
% {\em Provide a short description of your artifact.}

To defend DMA attacks effectively with low overhead, we design and implement \name, a novel hardware-software co-design to enforce spatial and temporal protection for DMA buffers. It registers information for each DMA buffer and signs the DMA pointers when creating DMA buffer mappings, and authenticates the DMA using the signature and corresponding buffer information, including a unique identifier and bounds.
\blfootnote{\Letter~Corresponding author.}
Before designing \name, we performed a detailed Characterization. We implemented \name on RISC-V and ARM QEMU, as well as on Rocket Chip based RISC-V SoC on FPGA.

This artifact contains the QEMU setup and analyzing tool to perform characterization, ARM and RISC-V QEMU with \name emulation, and FPGA-based SoC with \name and IOMMU hardware, as well as Linux kernels with corresponding drivers for each of the platforms described in implementation.

\subsection{Description \& Requirements}

% \textit{[Mandatory] This section should list all the information necessary to
% recreate the same experimental setup you have used to run your artifact. Where
% it applies, the minimal hardware and software requirements to run your artifact.
% It is also very good practice to list and describe in this section benchmarks
% where those are part of, or simply have been used to produce results with, your
% artifact.}
The private key and ssh configuration is provided in the HotCRP submission.

\subsubsection{Security, privacy, and ethical concerns}
% \textit{[Mandatory] Describe any risk for evaluators while executing your
% artifact to their machines security, data privacy or others ethical concerns.
% This is particularly important if destructive steps are taken or security
% mechanisms are disabled during the execution.}
None. But the reviewer may want to use VPN to connect to the provided server to avoid any potential information leakage.

\subsubsection{How to access}
% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{Describe here how to access your artifact. If you are
% applying for the Artifacts Available badge, the archived copy of the artifacts
% must be accessible via a stable reference or DOI. For this purpose, we recommend
% Zenodo, but other valid hosting options include institutional and
% third-party digital repositories (e.g., FigShare, Dryad, Software
% Heritage, GitHub, or GitLab â€” not personal webpages). For repositories that can
% evolve over time (e.g., GitHub), a stable reference to the evaluated version
% (e.g., a URL pointing to a commit hash or tag) rather than the evolving version
% reference (e.g., a URL pointing to a mere repository) is required. Note that the
% stable reference provided at submission time is for the purpose of Artifact
% Evaluation. Since the artifact can potentially evolve during the evaluation to
% address feedback from the reviewers, another (potentially different) stable
% reference will be later collected for the final version of the artifact (to be
% included here for the camera-ready version).}
The DOI is \code{10.5281/zenodo.12216074}.
It can be accessed via \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12216074}.
All the required copy of the files are contained in \code{/home/reviewer/Artifacts} in the provided server.
Reviewers may want to use the local version directly since the artifacts is quite large.


\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}
% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{Describe any specific hardware features required to
% evaluate your artifact (vendor, CPU/GPU/FPGA, number of processors/cores,
% microarchitecture, interconnect, memory, hardware counters, etc). If your
% artifact requires special hardware, please provide instructions on how to gain
% access to the hardware. For example, provide private SSH keys to access the
% machines remotely. Please keep in mind that the anonymity of the reviewers needs
% to be maintained and you may not collect or request personally identifying
% information (e.g., email, name, address). [Simply write "None." where this does
% not apply to your artifact.]}

The provided server is already connected to the hardware.

XCKU040 FPGA, FMC-to-PCIe adaptor card, SD card, PCIe device required to test the functionality of the SoC with DMAAUTH support.

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}
% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{Describe any specific OS and software packages
% required to evaluate your artifact. This is particularly important if you share
% your source code and it must be compiled or if you rely on some proprietary
% software that you cannot include in your package. In such a case, you must
% describe how to obtain and to install all third-party software, data sets, and
% models. [Simply write "None." where this does not apply to your artifact.]}
The provided server is already capable of running the artifact. The environment is Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS with the required package to build Linux kernel, and AMD Vivado 2022.02.

\subsubsection{Benchmarks}
% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{Describe here any data (e.g., data-sets, models,
% workloads, etc.) required by the experiments with this artifact reported in your
% paper.} \textit{[Simply write "None." where this does not apply to your
% artifact.]}
None.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Set-up}

% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{This section should include all the installation and
% configuration steps required to prepare the environment to be used for the
% evaluation of your artifact.}

The environment is already provided on the server. If using our provided server, skip the A.3.1 section.

For reviewers who want to try the artifact on their own machine, the following steps are required.

1. Please install the dependencies required to build the Linux kernel. 2. Please install Vivado 2022.2 to build the FPGA bitstream. 3. Download and extract the artifacts from provided zenodo DOI.

\subsubsection{Installation}
% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{Instructions to download and install dependencies as
% well as the main artifact. After these steps the evaluator should be able to run
% a simple functionality test.}
If using the provided server, no extra steps are required.

When evaluating the artifacts on your local machine, about 300GB of disk space is required. And we recommend using Ubuntu 22.04, the same distribution as we provided.

Please follow \url{https://phoenixnap.com/kb/build-linux-kernel} install required dependencies to build the Linux kernel.

Please download and install Vivado 2022.2 from \url{https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/archive.html}

\subsubsection{Basic Test}
% {\em [Mandatory]} \textit{Instructions to run a simple functionality test. Does
% not need to run the entire system, but should check that all required software
% components are used and functioning fine. Please include the expected successful
% output and any required input parameters.}

Please follow the following steps to run the basic test.

1. Go to the artifacts directory.

2. Enter the \texttt{fpga} directory.

3. Run \texttt{make auth-kernel \&\& make auth-fpga \&\& make auth-flash}. This command build the kernel and fpga stream and flash it to the FPGA. This may take about 1 hour to finish.

4. Enter \code{root} to login, a shell should start.
